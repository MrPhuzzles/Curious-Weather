# Curious Weather
A handy weather dashboard for the curious minds

## App description
This application allows a user to enter a city and view the current weather details as well as the 5-day forecast for the searched city.
Local storage stores a search history so a desired city can be re-selected. We use the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve the information
needed and it is then displayed on screen for the user!
